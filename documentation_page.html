 <h1>Time Series Plot for Oil Prices</h1>   
<h2>About</h2>
The aim of this project is to create a time series plot to help visualize data on the prices of oil from the year 1987 to 2020. <br>
Oil prices are subject to fluctuations and thus, it is hard to predict or tell what the next prices may be as a result of increased demand or low supply of oil.
<h2>Choice of Data </h2>
The data used for this project contains two variables; namely, the data and the prices of oil. 
These two variables are enough to achieve the objectives of this project.  <br>
Since the visualization is a time-series line plot, a time series data is a perfect choice for this project.
 <h2>Source of Data</h2>
The source of data is a public GitHub repository containing the data on oil prices from the year 1987 to the year 2020. <br>
The link to the data set is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasets/oil-prices/master/data/brent-daily.csv">GitHub's Oil Prices</a>
<h2>Visualization Design</h2>
The choice and design of a visualization plays a critical role in ensuring the visualization achieves the objectives of the project. <br>
The choice of the plot is a time-series line plot. A little interactivity is added to enable the users of the visualization to explore the data in depth through the visualization. <br>
The interactivity for this project is achieved through a brush that allows the user to zoom through a desired time and explore the oil-price fluctuations.
